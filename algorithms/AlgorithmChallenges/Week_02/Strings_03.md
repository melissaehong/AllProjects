###Book Index
Martin is writing his opus: a book of algorithm challenges, set as lyrics to a suite of baroque fugues. He knows that some of those fugueing challenges will be less popular than others, so he needs a book index. Given a sorted array of pages, produce a book index string. Consecutive pages should form ranges separated by a dash. For `[1,3,4,5,7,8,10]`, return the string `"1, 3-5, 7-8, 10"`.
