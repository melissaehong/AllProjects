##Arrays Day 4 ([Solutions](Arrays_04.js))

###Skyline Heights
From lovely Burbank you have a breathtaking view of the Los Angeles skyline. Letâ€™s say you are given an array with heights of consecutive buildings, starting closest to you and extending directly away. Array `[-1,7,3]` would represent three buildings: first is actually out of view below street level, behind it is second at 7 stories high, third is 3 stories high (hidden behind the 7-story). You are situated at street level. Return array containing heights of buildings you can see, in order. Given `[1,-1,7,3]` return `[1,7]`.

###Filter Range
Alan is good at breaking secret codes. One tool is to eliminate numbers he knows are outside a certain specific range. Given `array` and values `min` and `max`, remove array values outside min and max. Work in-place: return the array you are given, with values in original order. No built-in array functions.
