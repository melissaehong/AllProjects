##Arrays Day 2 ([Solutions](Arrays_02.js))

###Remove At
Given array and an index into array, remove and return the array value at that index. Do this without using built-in array methods except `pop()`. Think of `PopFront(arr)` as equivalent to `RemoveAt(arr,0)`.

###Swap Array Pairs
Swap positions of successive pairs of values of given array. If length is odd, do not change final element. For `[1,2,3,4]`, return `[2,1,4,3]`. For `[false,true,42]`, return `[true,false,42]`.

###Array Remove Duplicates
Sara is looking to hire an awesome web developer and has received applications from various sources. Her assistant alphabetized them but noticed some duplicates. Given a sorted array, remove duplicate values. Because array elements are already in order, all duplicate values will be grouped together.
