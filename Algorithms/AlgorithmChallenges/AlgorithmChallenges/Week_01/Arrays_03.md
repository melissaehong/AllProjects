##Arrays Day 3 ([Solutions](Arrays_03.js))

###Reverse array
Given a numerical array, reverse the order of the values. The reversed array should have the same length, with existing elements moved to other indices so that the order of elements is reversed.
 + BONUS: Don’t use a second array – move the values around within the array that you are given.

###Array Min to Front
Given an array of comparable values, move the lowest element to the array’s front, shifting backward elements that previously were ahead of it. Change `[4,2,1,3,5]` to `[1,4,2,3,5]`.
